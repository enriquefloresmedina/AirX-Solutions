# AwAir
Source code, and setup instructions, for a low-cost network of embedded systems that obtain measurements of Particulate Matter (PM) and other environmental parameters. The network is composed of nodes and gateways; the nodes obtain measurements and send the information to other nodes, while gateways are connected to WiFi and upload the information received from nodes to a cloud server. The main goal is the improvement of the conditions for public and private decision-making on environmental care and public health.
